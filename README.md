# Hello! I'm Jack Neeleman

I am an Aerospace Engineer and Mechanical Engineer with a strong passion for and foundation in programming.

## A few of my closed-source projects

**Project Venus**

I'm developing a large scale space simulaton game with n-body physics. I've developed my own engine and renderer from scratch in Rust to support the large scales without running into floating point rendering and simulation issues. With the engine I can have millimeter precision while simulating bodies on the scale of galaxies.

**Project Mercury**

I'm developing a voxel-based game capable of simulating tens of thousands of dynamic world interacting entities. I've developed my own engine and renderer from scratch in Rust that includes LOD chunks as well as greedy meshing of voxels and draw call batching. The game is multiplayer and uses a custom packet system I developed using websockets.
